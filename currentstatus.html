<h1>Back to school</h1>
<p>Since I have pretty much stopped pursuing my acting career, I decided to move into a new beloved career path...<br>
You guessed it! IT. This spawned a desire to go back to school and learn all things Business I.T related.<br><br>
Ever since then, my eyes (and brain) has opened up to this whole new world of computer systems I never thought I would know about let alone understand.<br>
Specifically pursuing a career in Systems Analysis, System Administration and a current growing love for Penetration Testing.</p><br>

<h2>What I am currently practising/studying</h2>
<p>Since my inception into the university lifestyle, I have tried to learn as much as possible outside of my studies.
Because I.T is broad of a subject I needed to specify what I wanted to learn and what would be the most valuable to me.<br>
So I first dived into the world of programming and boy oh boy I was not prepared for this course.<br>
Out of the four subjects I was doing in that semester this one was the hardest.<br>
Introduction to Programming it was called, and python was the main programming language taught.<br><br>
I'll tell you what, although it was difficult, and it was really the only subject I focused on (other subjects were business related)
I had an absolute blast.<br>
Never in my life I would have thought I would enjoy torture, but I did and it was bliss.
