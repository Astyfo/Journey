        <h1> <b>Martin Astifo's, Practise Makes Permanent</b> </h1>

        
        Learning the ropes when it comes to all things IT<br><br>
        
        I absolutely love IT and every aspect of it. I am creating this website for my own learning purposes as well as creating a free website and not having to spend a dine!<br><br>

        ^^^^^<br><br>

        Thats me from a movie called "The Faceless Man" that I shot with Chapter 5 Studios back in 2018<br><br>

        And yes I am an actor turned 'IT Geek'.<br><br>

        Why the sudden change? Well long story short, the entertainment industry is super cut-throat and i'm not a cut throat sorta guy.<br><br>
